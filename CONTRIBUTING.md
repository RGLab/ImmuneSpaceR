# Contributing to ImmuneSpaceR

## Opening issues

Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect and include a minimal reprex.

The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that I can fix it. If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading [this](https://github.com/jennybc/reprex#what-is-a-reprex).

Brief description of the problem
