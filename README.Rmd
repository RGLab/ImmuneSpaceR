A thin wrapper around Rlabkey to access the [ImmuneSpace]("https://www.immunespace.org") database from R.

This package simplifies access to the [HIPC](https://www.immuneprofiling.org/) ImmuneSpace database for R programmers. It takes advantage of the standardization of the database to hide all the [`Rlabkey`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rlabkey/index.html) specific code away from the user. The study-specific datasets can be accessed via an object-oriented paradigm.



## Installation

Install from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ImmuneSpaceR.html):

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("ImmuneSpaceR")
```

Or install the latest development version via [`remotes`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html):

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("RGLab/ImmuneSpaceR")
```

The database is accessed with the user's credentials. A `.netrc` file storing login and password information is required.

Create netrc file in the computer running R:

* On a **UNIX** system, this file should be named `.netrc`
* On **Windows**, it sould be named `_netrc`
* The file should be located in the user's **home** directory
* To determine home directory, run `Sys.getenv("HOME")` in R
* The permissions on this file should be unreadable for everybody except the owner

The following three lines must be included in the `.netrc` or `_netrc` file either separated by white space (spaces, tabs, or newlines) or commas.

```
machine www.immunespace.org
login myUser@mySite.com
password superSecretPassword
```

Multiple such blocks can exist in one file. Please ensure that the machine name in the netrc file contains the "www" prefix as that is how the package connects to immunespace by default. A mismatch will lead to connection failures.

See [the official documentation](https://www.labkey.org/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=netrc) from LabKey and the introductory vignette for an ImmuneSpace specific setup.



## Usage

### Create a connection

The general idea is that the user creates an instance of an `ImmuneSpaceConnection` class. The instance configures itself to connect to a specific study, and datasets and gene expression matrices can be retrieved by name.

For example:

```{r createConnection}
library(ImmuneSpaceR)
study <- CreateConnection("SDY269")
```

will create an instance of SDY269.


### List datasets

Datasets can be listed by:

```{r listDatasets}
study$listDatasets()
```

which will print names of available datasets and gene expression matrices.


### Retrieve datasets

Gene expression matrices or datasets can be retreived by:

```{r retrieveDatasets}
LAIV2008 <- study$getGEMatrix("SDY269_PBMC_LAIV_Geo")
elisa <- study$getDataset("elisa")
```

The study object *caches* data, so once it is retrieved, the next time you access it, it will use the local cached copy. The package uses a [R6](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R6/index.html) class system to represent the connection to a study and get around some of R's copy-on-change behaviour.


### Visualize

The `plot` method uses [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) functions to generate visualizations of datasets, leveraging the standardized dataset tables.

```{r plot}
study$plot("hai")
```
